# RNN
Simple RNN from Scratch (NumPy) This project implements a minimal Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using only NumPy to predict the fourth word in a 4-word sentence. It includes manual forward and backward passes, weight updates, and clear visualizations of each step. Ideal for learning the internals of RNNs without using high-level libraries.
